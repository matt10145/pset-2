# Problem Set 2

By Matthew Hui

### Exercise 1

I've written some code in `hello.js`, but it's broken. It's supposed to print a nice message to the console.

### Exercise 2

Prompt the user to enter his or her first name, and print a personalized message to the console.

* Use a `const` variable to represent the conversion factor between inches and millimeters.
* Round the result to two decimals, and format it with separating commas (if needed).
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 4

What is the perimeter (in centimeters) of an *l*-by-*w*-inch sheet of paper, where *l* and *w* are provided by the user?

![Exercise 4 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/perimeter.png)

* Your code must be written in a file named `perimeter.js`.
* Your prompts and printed text must match mine exactly (including spacing and punctuation).
* Use a `const` variable to represent the conversion factor between inches and centimeters.
* Round the result to two decimals, and format it with separating commas (if needed).
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 5

What is the length of the diagonal (in inches) between two corners on an *l*-by-*w*-inch sheet of paper, where *l* and *w* are provided by the user?

![Exercise 5 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/diagonal.png)

* Your code must be written in a file named `diagonal.js`.
* Your prompts and printed text must match mine exactly (including spacing and punctuation).
* Round the result to two decimals, and format it with separating commas (if needed).
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 6

Given the grading policy and the homework, quiz, and test grades I provide, what marking period grade will I get?

The grading policy defines the following weights.
* Homework, 15%
* Quizzes, 35%
* Tests, 50%

![Exercise 6 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/grades.png)

* Your code must be written in a file named `grades.js`.
* Your prompts and printed text must match mine exactly (including spacing and punctuation).
* Use `const` variables to represent the weights of each category.
* Round the result to two decimals.
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 7

I get paid by the hour as a cashier at a local supermarket. How much money will I make this week?

![Exercise 7 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/hourly.png)

* Medicare tax, 1.45%

![Exercise 8 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/salary.png)

* Your code must be written in a file named `salary.js`.
* Your prompts and printed text must match mine exactly (including spacing and punctuation).
* Use `const` variables to represent the 401k contribution and tax rates.
* Round the result to two decimals, and format it with separating commas (if needed).
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 9

I am planning a class trip next month. How many buses do I need, and how many people will be on the last bus? You can assume that all buses are filled to capacity before moving on to the next bus.

![Exercise 9 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/trip.png)

* Your code must be written in a file named `trip.js`.
* Your prompts and printed text must match mine exactly (including spacing and punctuation).
* Use `const` variables to represent the number of students and teachers, as well as the bus capacity.
* Round the result to two decimals, and format it with separating commas (if needed).
* Conditional statements and loops are not permitted.

### Exercise 10

What is the surface area of a standard Cornhole board? The board is 48-by-24 inches, with a hole 6-inches in diameter. Write code to do the math - don't just print the answer!

![Exercise 10 Output](https://github.com/ap-principles-ucvts/pset-2-skeleton/blob/master/images/cornhole.png)

## Deadline

Please read very carefully. Historically, most students lose points on problem sets for simply failing to read the instructions and requirements.

* October 27, 2019, at 11:59pm.

If you submit your problem set at midnight (i.e., October 28, 2019, at 12:00am), it is considered **late**!

### Submission Requirements

* Your code **must** compile. Code that fails to meet this minimum requirement will not be accepted.
* There must be **at least** 10 unique commits to your repository.
* Your code must meet each requirement outlined in the Exercises and Deliverables sections.
* Your code must adhere to the course style guidelines.

Happy coding!
